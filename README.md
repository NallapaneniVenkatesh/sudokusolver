This a code to solve sudoku puzzle using python code. In this we take unsolved sudoku puzzle as input in form of 2-D array and then
we solve it using backtrack algorithm. we solve it and we print the result of the puzzle. If there is no solution we print message 
saying there is no solution for given puzzle.Further developments are taking input from user either using input function or taking
a photo then using imageprocessing to read the image and identify numbers and then create a sudoku puzzle input as 2-D array inside
the code.
